Lunch Oracle Redux, based on Starter React Redux App
====================================================

This app is a very small scaffold to get me started using Redux with React, and it's a remix of [starter-react-redux](https://starter-react-redux.glitch.me).

I use the "Lunch Oracle" application shape to learn new libraries and tools. It's a non-trivial task that I have defined very tightly in my mind and have been using it for 15+ years.

The app maintains the original routes of the starter app it was remixed from, as a way to learn about how to integrate with existing Redux code.

Click `Show` in the header to see the app live. Updates to the code will instantly deploy and update live.

My Project
----------

On the front-end,
- edit files in `app` folder, it contains all the React stuff
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
